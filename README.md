## Basic-Object-Oriented-Programming

This repository contains a collection of educational material and exercises for learning basic object-oriented programming in C++. The material is intended for students who have some experience with programming in C++, but who have not yet learned object-oriented programming. See the [course website]() for more information. This can be used to teach basic object-oriented programming concepts. The material is designed to be used in a classroom setting, but can also be used for self-study.

## Environment
*Requirement:* You need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer. You can use any compiler you like, but the following instructions are for the GNU C++ compiler (g++). If you are using a Linux computer, you can install the g++ compiler using the following command. 

```bash
sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install make
```
